# Michigan-Crime-Visualization

In this project we found a visualization from online and our goal was to replicate it, improve it, and then make alternate visualizations of the data that show new insights.

The visualization compares Michigan's violent crime rate to that of the United States as a whole. We found data for the crime rates in US states and, in RStudio, wrangled it to create these visualizations.
